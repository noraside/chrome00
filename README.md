## What is Gramado OS Kernel?

Gramado OS Kernel is 64bit image running in ring 0.

## Kernel initialization

```
 See: kmain.c:
 First function is I_main().
 The kernel initialization in I_initialize_kernel():
```

```
// ==================================
// Levels:
// + [1]   earlyinit()
// + [2:0] mmInitialize(0)
// + [2:1] mmInitialize(1)
// + [3:0] keInitialize(0)
// + [3:1] keInitialize(1)
// + [3:2] keInitialize(2)
// + [4]   archinit()
// + [5]   deviceinit()
// + [6]   lateinit()
// ==================================
```

## What is Gramado Operating System?

GramadoOS is a 64-bit graphical operating system, featuring a bootloader, kernel, and a desktop environment. This is the first distribution created using the Gramado OS kernel.

This image shows the first process that runs after the kernel initialization.

You can install a desktop environment on top of the kernel. The default desktop environment is located in the gdeps/ folder.

## What is the category it belongs to? 

Gramado OS is a hobby operating system.
It is not a commercial system; it is small and offers only a limited set of features.

## Kernel features.

```
Hardware Support
CPU: Intel and AMD, 64-bit only
Memory: Paging, 2MB chunks using 4KB pages
Block device: IDE (Primary master only)
Character devices: PS/2 keyboard, PS/2 mouse (works best in QEMU), Serial port (COM, used for debugging)
Network: Intel e1000 NIC (works in Oracle VirtualBox)
```

```
Software
Processes and threads
Preemptive thread switching
Round-robin scheduler (threads only)
Syscalls via software interrupts (traps)
IPC: sockets and system messages (queue in thread structure)
Four ring 0 kernel virtual consoles (fullscreen raw mode)
General-use TTYs and PTYs for ring 3 virtual terminals
FAT16 file system for boot partition (no dedicated system partition yet)
POSIX libc: ring 0 implementation for ring 3 libraries
Basic networking: sockets, small ring 0 protocol stack (Ethernet, ARP, IP, UDP, TCP, DHCP)
Display: Bootloader display device (VESA)
Minimal user structure
Loadable ring 0 module (static address)
```

## Userland features.

```
Display server
Unix-like commands in the virtual console
Some clients connect to the display server via Unix sockets
Ring 3 processes can access I/O ports via syscall (for ring 3 drivers only)
```

## userland system programs.

> * The network server. (Work in progress)

## userland commands.

See cmds/.

## DE - Desktop Environment

## Gramado API 

You can find the API to create client-side GUI applications in apps/.

## Demos

This is a screenshot of 3D demo running on top of the kernel.
You can find code in the zde/aurora/ folder.

## Notes on Building an OS

```
Building an operating system is a great way to learn how systems work and 
to understand the full software stack required to run applications.
However, if your goal is to make money, high demand is typically found in 
application development (web front-end and back-end).

## Building and Running on VM

```bash
$ make
$ ./run
```
ps: Do NOT use the fancy '-j' thingy for now.

## Cleaning Up for a Fresh Compilation

```bash
$ make clean-all
```

## What are the host machine to build the project?

> * Gramado OS has been compiled and tested on Ubuntu LTS releases, 
>   including WSL2 on Windows and various Ubuntu versions.
> * A typical build environment:

```

## Testing

> * Virtual Machines: Tested on QEMU, QEMU with KVM, and VirtualBox.
> * Physical Machines: Older versions tested on real hardware (e.g., Intel Core 2 Duo, VIA chipset).

## Can I test the system on a virtual machine?

Yes, you can test the system on a virtual machine.
The system has been tested by Fred Nora on qemu, qemu with kvm and virtualbox.
Now, Fred Nora is testing the system only on qemu and virtualbox.

## Can I test the system on a real machine?

Yes, we can test the system in the real machines. 
This way we can improve the system. 
The older versions of the system were tested for a long period of time 
on a real machine. That machine was a Gigabyte machine 
with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and a VIA chipset.

## Documentation

Documentation and design notes are in the docs/ folder.

> See the [docs](https://github.com/frednora/gramado/tree/main/docs).

The project is looking for some people to create a better documentation, for free, 
as a contribuition to the open source community. To create this new documentation 
we can use the documentation in docs/ and the design notes 
found all over the project.
